                        Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer,<br> space transportation services 
                        and communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne,<br> California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal 
                        of reducing space<br> transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon 9<br> and Falcon Heavy 
                        launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Dragon cargo,<br> crew spacecraft and Starlink communications satellites.
                        <br><br><br>
                
                SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit<br> (Falcon 1 in 2008),
                 the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a<br> spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private
                  company to send a spacecraft to the International <br>Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first vertical take-off and 
                  vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket<br> (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital 
                  rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send <br>
                astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 in 2020).<br> SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.
                <br><br><br>
                SpaceX is developing a satellite megaconstellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service.<br>
                 In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched. <br>
                 SpaceX is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system <br>
                 for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once <br>
                 operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet. Starship will be fully<br>
                  reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, <br>
                  scheduled for the early 2020s.
